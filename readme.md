## VGA and FPGAs

The blue, green, red componenets support 4 levels of brightness.

See [Simulations 01](./img/01.png), [Simulations 10](./img/10.png) and [Simulations 11](./img/11.png) 
for the details of the DAC implementation (modeled with [Electronic Circuit Simulator](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html)).

Here are the TinyFPGA BX and the 4-bit DAC that on the [the breadboard](./img/bb_fpga.jpg) that are connected to a VGA input.
KiCAD schematic and the rendered pdf are under the [kicad](./kicad) directory.
